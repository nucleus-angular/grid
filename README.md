# Grid

*ON HOLD*

This component is currently on hold as far as development goes as I am contemplating if I want to continue development on it.  I have started to shy away from using these grid type components because when displaying lists of data, I have found myself quite often displaying the data in quite varying ways (and having the stanard view is one of the bigger benefits to grid components for me).  The grid component is currently one of the top 3 complex components included in Nucleus Angular (extend text and rest being the other 2 with the other components being a lot less complex relative to these) and since there are other descent alternatives (like http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/), I may drop this from Nucleus Angular in order to help focus on the other complex components in which I don't like the other alternatives.
